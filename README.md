# Meade Banking App
## Elia Rice
The Meade Bank application is a functional banking application that allows clients to make accounts, allows employees to view said accounts, and allows administrators to make changes to the accounts.

Specifically, a client can register and appply for an account at the bank. Upon application approval, the client will then be able to check his balance, add money to his account, and make withdraws. A client may also (in conjunction with a second client) apply for a joint bank account. An approved account may not be converted into a joint account, the application must be made at account creation.

Employees, upon making their account, are able to approve or deny the applications of clients. They can also view the balance and personal information of current clients. Administrators have all the priveleges of employees, as well as the ability to alter the balance of client accounts.
